# GoMoBee


So got your first landing page work to do for a client. 

GoMoBee is on the cusp of launching, 

they've requested a landing page from Figma be created created in their account. 

The basic steps are:


Login to advicator platform and select the GoMoBee account

Go to the landing page section then manage pages 

Right click on one of the landing pages (I would suggest using the o2 one for 3G template and wifi for wifi template) and then duplicate. This way you'll be able to replicate the exact layout we've already done for them 

Then using their figma templates (here: https://www.figma.com/file/JhjKgj1IHTNpNNMFofkoDs/DE-%5BGames%5D---Fortnite-S6-Run-wild--(Advicator)?node-id=180%3A42) export the relevant layers (If you need help on using figma, pepx is an expert on it. She can show you how to group the right layers and export them)

Then upload the relevant background image. 

Hit save for now (remember to change the name) go to the media library and upload the images from the header and inspect the URL 

Put the media library image locations into the landing page input fields
